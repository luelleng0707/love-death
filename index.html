        in changing societal norms, offering a compelling contrast to the depictions in <b>Romeo and Juliet, Chava,</b> and <b>Lust, caution</b>.

        <div class="title-section"> <h1>ROMEO AND JULIET</h1>
            <div class="subtitle"> In <b>Romeo and Juliet,</b> love is a powerful, all-consuming force that defies societal constraints but ends in tragedy, 
                while modern relationships now as seen on the video, often thrive on mutual growth and fewer external barriers.

            <p><i>“Did my heart love till now? Forswear it, sight! For I ne&#39;er saw true beauty till this night.”</i> (Act 1, Scene 5)</p>
        </div>
        <div class="explanation-section">
            <div class="explanation-text">
                <p>This reflects the intensity and immediacy of traditional romantic love. In contrast, modern love often emphasizes compatibility, communication, and gradual connection over instantaneous attraction.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="quote-section" id="2">
            <p><i>“My bounty is as boundless as the sea, / My love as deep; the more I give to thee, / The more I have, for both are infinite.”</i> (Act 2, Scene 2)</p>
        </div>
        <div class="explanation-section">
            <div class="explanation-text">
                <p>Juliet&#39;s declaration of boundless love mirrors the idealized, almost divine notion of love in traditional romance. Modern love may still seek depth but often frames it within pragmatic boundaries, such as mutual respect and shared values.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="quote-section" id="3">
            <p><i>“These violent delights have violent ends / And in their triumph die, like fire and powder, / Which, as they kiss, consume.”</i> (Act 2, Scene 6)</p>

            <div class="explanation-text">
                <p>Friar Laurence warns against the intensity of impulsive love, highlighting its potential for destruction. This resonates with the modern caution about “burnout” in relationships, as contemporary norms emphasize balance and emotional health.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="quote-section" id="4">
            <p><i>“A plague o&#39; both your houses! / They have made worms&#39; meat of me.”</i> (Act 3, Scene 1)</p>
        </div>
        <div class="explanation-section">
            <div class="explanation-text">
                <p>Mercutio&#39;s curse on the feuding families underscores how societal norms and external conflicts can affect relationships. While societal expectations shaped traditional romances heavily, modern love often challenges or redefines these norms.</p>

        <div class="quote-section" id="5">
            <p><i>“For never was a story of more woe / Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.”</i> (Act 5, Scene 3)</p>

        <div class="explanation-section">
            <div class="explanation-text">
                <p>The tragedy of Romeo and Juliet lies in their inability to reconcile love with the constraints of their world. In contrast, modern love often seeks to overcome such barriers through open-mindedness and flexibility, though challenges persist.</p>
